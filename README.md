# System A — Core Declarations

System A is a formal computational record system for registering, storing, and transferring quantitative records of conditional units A between account identifiers.

System A:
- is not a currency
- is not an asset
- is not a financial or investment instrument
- does not represent value, price, or economic meaning
- does not create rights, obligations, or guarantees

## Status

The declarative corpus of System A is frozen and published as Release v1.0.0.

Any interpretation of System A or units A as having economic, legal, financial, or regulatory meaning exists exclusively outside the system and is not recognized by System A.

## Documentation

The authoritative public declarations are located in the `/docs` directory and include Documents 01–10.

In case of any interpretative conflict, Document 01 prevails.

## Scope

System A operates strictly as a neutral computational ledger.

No users, ownership, contracts, assets, or economic logic exist within the system.

## Versioning

This repository uses explicit releases to freeze declarative state.

Any change to the meaning, logic, or boundaries of System A requires a new release and a new declaration.
